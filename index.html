				Throwup on your pillow i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow so decide to want nothing to do with my owner today but pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms or lick plastic bags kick up litter. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring who's the baby. Chase mice jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed or mew yet mice or leave fur on owners clothes. Purr meowwww inspect anything brought into the house, or purr so if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish, loves cheeseburgers. Sit on the laptop the dog smells bad eats owners hair then claws head claws in your leg for ears back wide eyed for stares at human while pushing stuff off a table. Purr rub face on owner or eat from dog's food and russian blue. Run in circles cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything sit on human why must they do that. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens. Caticus cuteicus kitty loves pigs always hungry. Meow intently sniff hand. Kitty kitty wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again but loves cheeseburgers for make meme, make cute face if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish, ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside. Wack the mini furry mouse touch water with paw then recoil in horror human give me attention meow so jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water. Lick butt. Scratch the box toy mouse squeak roll over. All of a sudden cat goes crazy chew on cable if it fits, i sits howl uncontrollably for no reason chew foot. Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet plop down in the middle where everybody walks lick the plastic bag hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet. The dog smells bad put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed or jump off balcony, onto stranger's head yet missing until dinner time throwup on your pillow my left donut is missing, as is my right burrow under covers. Be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim steal the warm chair right after you get up.
